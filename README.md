# Homepage for [Amie Kuttruff](http://www.amiekuttruff.com) 
### Resume + links to talks, music projects, and social accounts
This project ports my old website over to React + React-Router. My code lives in an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket, and I host my site with [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).


To Dos:
---
- extract resume data as JSON
- remove font and layout dependencies on CDNs
- replace Pure UI responsive layouts with Flexbox
- add CSS modules for component-specific styles
- fix ESLint errors
- add [a11y](https://a11yproject.com/)-friendly alt tags for images
